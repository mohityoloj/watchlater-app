# Scope Justification for photoslibrary.readonly

The WatchLater Photos Sync app requires the photoslibrary.readonly scope to allow users to view and sync their Google Photos library inside the application.

This scope is used only to:
- Read photo metadata
- Read media items
- Display the user’s photos and albums in the interface

The app does not:
- Modify photos
- Delete photos
- Upload new photos
- Change albums or metadata

Read-only access is essential for the core functionality of letting users browse and organize their existing Google Photos content within the WatchLater Photos Sync interface.
