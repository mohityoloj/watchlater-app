\# Privacy Policy for WatchLater Photos Sync



Last updated: January 2026



WatchLater Photos Sync (“the App”) is a personal project created by an individual developer. This App allows users to sign in with their Google account and sync metadata from their Google Photos library into their own storage.



\## Information We Collect



The App requests access only to the following information:

\- Basic Google account information (name, email)

\- Google Photos metadata (file name, creation date, media URL, album name)



The App does \*\*not\*\* collect or store:

\- Photo or video files

\- Sensitive personal information

\- Location data beyond what is included in Google Photos metadata



\## How Your Data Is Used



The App uses your Google Photos metadata solely to:

\- Display your media information inside the App

\- Sync metadata into your own database (e.g., Supabase) if configured



Your data is \*\*never\*\* sold, shared, or used for advertising.



\## Data Storage



All metadata is stored only in your own connected database.  

No data is stored or processed on any external servers controlled by the developer.



\## Third‑Party Services



The App uses:

\- Google OAuth for authentication

\- Google Photos API for metadata access



These services are governed by their own privacy policies.



\## User Control



You may revoke the App’s access to your Google account at any time by visiting:

https://myaccount.google.com/permissions



Once access is revoked, the App can no longer read your Google Photos metadata.
